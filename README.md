Code associated with manuscript "Hyperpolarization-activated cation channels shape the spiking frequency preference of human cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons"

Here, we provide code to generate the figures in the main text. 

Figure 1: Code used to generate the Frequency Dependent Gain curves for model human L5 
cortical pyramidal neuron under normal conditions and without h-current activity. 

Figure 2: Code to run a single simulation of NEURON via Python interface to demonstrate 
the Currentscape visualization tool that facilitates the identification of relative current 
contributions in spiking simulations within the human neuron model. 

Figure 3: Code to run the four different h current scenarios using Currentscape visualization 
tool and its corresponding output current and Frequency Dependent Gain Curves within the human 
neuron model.

Figure 4: Code to generate outward and inward current plots specific to 30ms, 100ms, and 200ms 
prior to a spike for Spike Triggered Average curve within the human neuron model. 

Figure 5: Code to generate plots demonstrating the non-monotonic nature of h-current activity 
prior to spiking within three different Ih scenarios through Spike Triggered Average and 
Frequency Dependent Gain curves within the human neuron model. 

Figure 6: Code used to generate the Frequency Dependent Gain curves for model rodent L5 cortical 
pyramidal neuron under normal conditions and without h-current activity. Code to generate inward 
plots specific to 200ms prior to a spike for Spike Triggered Average curve within the rodent 
neuron model.
