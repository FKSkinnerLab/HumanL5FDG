Using DefineProcs.hoc function of "noiserun()" that outputs the voltage, current, and individual current traces for each ion channel during the simulation.

Run NEURON with Currentscape visualization via Python file makeNoise_run_cur.py and using Noise file 1. The Python file incorporates Currentscape function from currents_visualziation_STA.py. 

Take the inputs from this simulation (voltage, current, and individual ion channel currents) and plot them using Plotcurve to show the necessity of having currentscape to adequately visualize the currents of the individual ion channels.
