To produce Currentscape, run NEURON human model via the theta.py files, specific to each Ih scenario. Theta.py files incorporates the NEURON human model, logistics to run Currentscape via the currents_visualization_STA.py file, and utilizing the 30 noise files (generated by makeNoise.m and run_makeNoise_042.m) in the noiserun() obtained from DefineProcs.hoc. 

To obtain graphs specific to figure 3, utilize noise file 1.

To obtain graphs for the corresponding input current trace associated with FDG specific to a noise file, run "FDG traceplot_0808.m" utilizing the current, voltage, and time excel spreadsheets produced from noiserun() specific to each noise file

To obtain the Frequency Dependent Gain curves specific to each of the Ih scenarios, as an average of the 30 noise files, use run_freqDepGain which imports the output voltage and current plots specific to each of the 30 noise files. This will run the frequency dependent gain measure generating a frequency dependent plot for each individual noise profile and the average profile. Prior to using "run_freqDepGain", first run in the following order:

	1. "sl_sync_params.m" as a directory for parameters 
	2. "freqDepGain.m" as the function for FDG
	3. Using the "freqDepGain.m" function, run "run_freqDepGain_0924.m" using noise files
